OPTICAL CHARACTER


RECOGNITION


WHAT IS ocR?
OCR (OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION) CONVERTS VIRTUALLY ANY KIND OF IMAGE CONTAINING WRITTEN TEXT (TYPED, HANDWRITTEN, OR PRINTED) INTO MACHINE- READABLE TEXT DATA.
It is used for:
PASSPORT RECOGNITION FOR AIRPORTS,
TRAFFIC SIGN RECOGNITION FOR AIRPORTS,
EXTRACTING CONTACT INFORMATION,
CONVERTING HANDWRITTEN NOTES TO MACHINE- READABLE TEXT,
Data Entry,etc…








EXPLORING THE MECHANICS OF OCR:
Through the use of OCR technology, computers can transform text images into machine-readable text.


Image Acquisition: OCR starts with getting an image with text, which
can be scanned, photographed, or extracted from a digital file.


Preprocessing: Before OCR, the image is prepared to improve
recognition. This involves tasks like reducing noise, converting to black
and white, straightening tilted text, and removing background noise.


Segmentation: In this step, OCR separates text areas in the image
into lines, words, and characters. Accurate segmentation is key for
proper text recognition.


Feature Extraction: After identifying text, OCR extracts features like shape, size, and spatial relationships to
distinguish characters. This helps recognize visual patterns in the text.


UNVEILING OCR: FROM IMAGE TO ACCURATE TEXT:
Recognition: OCR analyses extracted features to recognize
characters in photos using machine learning methods, such as
neural networks. These algorithms are able to precisely identify
objects since they have been trained on big datasets.


Post-processing: Images are prepped before OCR to improve
recognition. Among the tasks are background noise removal,
skewed text straightening, noise reduction, and black-and-white
conversion.


Output: The output of the OCR process is machine-readable
text that can be modified, searched, processed, or analysed by
software. Depending on the requirements of the application,
output types can be plain text, searchable PDFs, or editable
documents like Microsoft Word.


EXPLORING KEY ASPECTS OF OCR:
1. Image Acquisition:


Scanning: Physical documents are scanned using flatbed scanners, document scanners, or handheld scanners.
Image Capture: Text can be captured from images taken by cameras, smartphones, or other imaging devices.
File Import: OCR software can also process digital image files such as JPEGs, TIFFs, or PDFs.


2. Preprocessing:


Noise Reduction: Eliminating unwanted artifacts or speckles from the image.
Binarization: Converting the image to binary format (black and white) to enhance text visibility.
Deskewing: Straightening tilted text lines to improve alignment for accurate recognition.
Contrast Enhancement: Adjusting the contrast to make text stand out from the background.


3. Feature Extraction:


Structural Features: Analyzing the spatial arrangement and shape of text components.
Statistical Features: Calculating statistical properties such as pixel intensity distributions.
Transformation Features: Representing text using mathematical transformations like Fourier descriptors.


4. Recognition:


Pattern Matching: Comparing extracted features with pre-trained patterns to identify characters.
Machine Learning: Utilizing supervised learning techniques to train models on labeled datasets of text images.
Neural Networks: Deep learning architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for
character recognition.




OUR GOAL:
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) aims to translate text from images into
machine-readable text so computers can process, modify, search, or analyze
the data.


Reduce the requirement for human data entry while improving data
accessibility and usability across a range of applications.

OBJECT DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION:
OBJECT DETECTION->
Object detection is a pivotal task in computer vision,
entailing the identification and localization of objects within
images or video frames. Unlike image classification, which
assigns a single label to an entire image, object detection
not only recognizes objects but also precisely outlines them

Data Sensors


Data sensors, also known as sensors or data acquisition sensors, are devices designed to
collect information from the physical world and convert it into electrical signals or
digital data.


Data sensors play a crucial role in monitoring and ensuring the efficient and safe
operation of various ship systems.


These sensors collect data related to the ship's condition, environment, and
performance.


Example of data sensors are Speed log ,Shaft motor , Thrust meter , Echo sounder ,GPS,ETC….




Example of Data Sensor


It measures the torque, speed, and power of a propeller shaft.


These three values are important to understanding the performance of
any ship, and specifically allow you to diagnose propulsion problems as
they occur.


It takes three parameters such as torque, speed, power.


If we supply 110-230V AC as Input we get Output Voltage as 0-10V and Output Current
as 4-20mA


Fully Modular System: Shafts from 150mm to 1,100mm (and above)


We can fetch the data from Output ports RS485, RS232, Modbus, Ethernet, and USB LOGGING






Historical Data


Historical data refers to information collected and recorded from sensors over a past period.


It serves as a valuable resource for understanding trends, patterns, and performance fluctuations over time.


Insights from historical data can aid in making informed decisions about maintenance scheduling, predicting equipment
failures, and optimizing operational processes.


It is often analyzed using statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, or other analytical tools to identify long-term
patterns, anomalies, and potential correlations.






information captured by sensors and processed instantly, providing a current snapshot of the
system's state.


Operators can make immediate adjustments based on real-time insights, optimizing performance and minimizing downtime.


Real-time data is crucial for triggering alerts and notifications when predefined thresholds or abnormal conditions are
detected.


It enables continuous monitoring of equipment, allowing for immediate response to changing conditions or emerging issues.


Real-time data is characterized by minimal delay between data acquisition and availability for analysis, often occurring within
milliseconds or seconds.


Real-time data is often integrated into control systems to enable automated responses and adjustments.
